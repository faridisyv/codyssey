          <h2 id="history">History of Python</h2>
          <p>
            Python's development started in the late 1980s when Guido van Rossum began working on it as a hobby project. He aimed to create a language that emphasized code readability and simplicity. The first official release of Python, version 0.9.0, came in 1991.
          </p>
          <p>
            Python's name is inspired by the British comedy group Monty Python, a nod to van Rossum's quirky sense of humor. Over the years, Python has evolved through various versions, with significant improvements and additions to its features and standard library.
          </p>
          <p>
            Python's popularity surged in the 2000s due to its use in web development, data analysis, and scientific computing. Today, Python is widely adopted across industries and is supported by a vibrant and enthusiastic community of developers.
