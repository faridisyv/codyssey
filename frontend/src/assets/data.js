      title: "History of Python",
      content: `
        <p>Python's development started in the late 1980s when Guido van Rossum began working on it as a hobby project. He aimed to create a language that emphasized code readability and simplicity. The first official release of Python, version 0.9.0, came in 1991.</p>
        <p>Python's name is inspired by the British comedy group Monty Python, a nod to van Rossum's quirky sense of humor. Over the years, Python has evolved through various versions, with significant improvements and additions to its features and standard library.</p>
        <p>Python's popularity surged in the 2000s due to its use in web development, data analysis, and scientific computing. Today, Python is widely adopted across industries and is supported by a vibrant and enthusiastic community of developers.</p>

        <p>Over the years, Python has evolved through various versions, each bringing significant improvements and additions to its features and standard library. Python 1.0, released in January 1994, introduced key features like lambda, map, filter, and reduce. Python 2.0, released in October 2000, added list comprehensions, garbage collection, and support for Unicode, marking a significant enhancement in its capabilities.</p>

        <p>The most transformative change came with Python 3.0, released in December 2008. This version was designed to rectify fundamental design flaws in the language. Python 3 introduced several changes that were not backward compatible with Python 2, such as the print function, integer division, and a more consistent approach to string handling with a distinction between bytes and Unicode strings. Despite initial resistance due to compatibility issues, Python 3 has now become the standard, with Python 2 reaching its end of life in January 2020.</p>

        <p>Python's popularity surged in the 2000s due to its use in web development, data analysis, and scientific computing. Frameworks like Django and Flask made Python a go-to choice for web developers, while libraries like NumPy, SciPy, and pandas solidified its position in scientific and analytical applications.</p>

        <p>List comprehensions provide a concise way to create lists in Python. They allow you to generate lists based on existing lists or other iterable objects, applying a condition and/or transformation to each element.</p>
        <p>The syntax for a list comprehension is [expression for item in iterable if condition], where 'expression' is the operation to perform on each item, 'item' is the variable representing each element in the iterable, and 'condition' is an optional filter.</p>
        <p>For example, you can create a list of squares of numbers from 1 to 10 using a list comprehension: [x**2 for x in range(1, 11)]. This will generate the list [1, 4, 9, 16, 25, 36, 49, 64, 81, 100].</p>

        <p>Lambda functions, also known as anonymous functions, are small, inline functions that can have any number of arguments but only one expression. They are defined using the lambda keyword and are commonly used in combination with functions like map(), filter(), and reduce().</p>
        <p>The syntax for a lambda function is lambda arguments: expression. For example, a lambda function that adds two numbers can be defined as lambda x, y: x + y.</p>
        <p>Lambda functions are useful for writing short, throwaway functions without the need to define a separate function using the def keyword. They are often used in situations where a function is needed for a short period of time, such as sorting or filtering data.</p>

      title: "Map, Filter, and Reduce",
      content: `
        <p>Map, filter, and reduce are built-in functions in Python that are used for functional programming. They allow you to apply a function to each element of an iterable, filter elements based on a condition, and perform a reduction operation on a sequence of elements, respectively.</p>
        <p>The map() function applies a given function to each item of an iterable (list, tuple, etc.) and returns a list of the results. It takes two arguments: the function to apply and the iterable to apply it to.</p>
        <p>The filter() function filters elements of an iterable based on a given condition and returns a list of elements for which the condition is true. It takes two arguments: the function that defines the condition and the iterable to filter.</p>
        <p>The reduce() function performs a binary operation on a sequence of elements and returns a single value. It repeatedly applies the function to pairs of elements until only one value remains. The reduce() function is part of the functools module and must be imported before use.</p>
        <p>Functional programming techniques like map, filter, and reduce can lead to more concise and readable code, especially when dealing with lists or other iterable data structures.</p>

      title: "Decorators",
      content: `
        <p>Decorators are a powerful feature in Python that allow you to modify the behavior of functions or methods without changing their code. They are implemented using the @decorator syntax and are commonly used for tasks such as logging, authentication, and memoization.</p>
        <p>A decorator is a function that takes another function as input and returns a new function that extends or modifies the behavior of the original function. Decorators are often used to add functionality to existing functions without modifying their code directly.</p>
        <p>Decorators can be applied to functions using the @decorator_name syntax. When a function is decorated, it is replaced by the result of the decorator function, which may include additional functionality or modifications to the original function.</p>
        <p>Decorators are a powerful tool for code reuse and abstraction, allowing you to separate concerns and keep your code clean and modular.</p>
      `
    },
    {
      title: "Generators",
      content: `
        <p>Generators are functions that allow you to generate a sequence of values lazily, one at a time, instead of storing them in memory all at once. They are implemented using the yield keyword and are useful for dealing with large datasets or infinite sequences.</p>
        <p>Unlike regular functions that return a single value and then exit, generators return an iterator that can yield multiple values over time. Each time the generator's next() method is called, it resumes execution from the last yield statement and continues until the next yield statement or the end of the function is reached.</p>
        <p>Generators are memory efficient because they only generate values as needed, rather than storing them in memory all at once. This makes them ideal for processing large datasets or performing computations on-the-fly.</p>
        <p>Generators are commonly used in combination with other Python features like list comprehensions, for loops, and the itertools module to perform complex tasks efficiently.</p>
